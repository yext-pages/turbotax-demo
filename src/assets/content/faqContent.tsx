      "What’s the difference between Intuit TurboTax Verified Pro and other TurboTax services?",
    children: (

        <p>
          TurboTax offers a variety of products and services to suit your tax-prep needs. There are a few key differences between Intuit TurboTax Verified Pro and our other live tax-prep help.
        </p>
        <p>
          With TurboTax Verified Pro, you match with independent tax preparers, qualified to handle your tax returns, no matter how complex. It's important to know that tax preparers on TurboTax Verified Pro run their own tax practices, and are not TurboTax employees. That means you get to work directly with your tax pro to create the agreements of your working relationship.
        </p>
        <p>
        Just like other TurboTax tax prep services, your tax return is backed by <Link to={"turboTaxGuarantees"}>TurboTax guarantees</Link>, so you get peace of mind that your taxes are done right.

  {
    title: "What’s the process like?",
    children: (
      <p>
        First, tell us a bit about you and your taxes. Then, match with a Verified Pro who can
        handle your unique situation and understands your local or state tax laws. Next, schedule an
        intro call to get to know your tax pro and learn if it’s a good fit. After your intro call,
        securely share your tax documents with your Verified Pro online or in person, where
        available. Once they’ve completed your tax return, your tax pro reviews it with you and
        answers any questions you have. Finally, you can relax while your pro prepares, signs and
        files your return for you.
      </p>

    title: "What qualifications do the tax preparers on TurboTax Verified Pro have?",
    children: (
      <p>
        Every tax preparer found on TurboTax Verified Pro is authorized to file with the IRS. Each
        tax pro has a profile page that shows their credentials and specialized tax expertise. We

    title: "How does Intuit verify each independent tax professional?",

      <p>
        Your security is built into everything we do. Intuit confirms each tax preparer’s identity,
        tax preparer authorization, as well as any state licenses and credentials before they’re

  {
    title: "How are fees/prices determined?",
    children: (
      <p>
        Your Verified Pro sets the price to file your return, based on the complexity of your tax
        return and the amount of tax forms required to complete your return. Your location and the
        time of year may also influence the price to complete your tax return. Your tax pro will set
        the price for filing after they learn more about you and before they prepare your return.

  {
    title: "Will a Verified Pro understand the complexities of my personal tax situation?",
    children: (
      <p>
        We use information about your tax situation to match you with a professional who has
        experience with taxes like yours. During the process, your Verified Pro will learn more
        about your taxes, so they can make sure your return is 100% accurate. Be sure to share all
        information as accurately as possible with your tax pro.

        call.

  {
    title: "Can I meet my Intuit TurboTax Verified Pro in person?",
    children: (
      <>
        <p>
          Yes, you can meet with your tax preparer in person, if they are available. When you start
          TurboTax Verified Pro, we'll ask if you'd like to meet in person. If you choose "I want to
          meet in person," we will match you with a Verified Pro who is available to meet in person.
        </p>
        <p>
          Keep in mind, a Verified Pro is an independent tax preparer who sets their own work
          preferences. Meeting in person might not be available in all cases.

          tax pro up to date on changes in your life and tax situation.

        standard encryption technology to make sure your information is protected.

    children: (
      <p>
        Your independent Verified Pro will work to complete your tax return as quickly as possible.
        The exact time can vary, depending on your unique tax situation and your work agreement with
        your tax pro. While we've seen some returns processed in as little as 4 days, other returns
